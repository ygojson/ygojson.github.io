## Project Goals

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Portable files" icon="document">
    Our main goal is to provide portable files to be dropped and use by any project.
    First we will focus on JSON, but we won't stop there!
	</Card>
  <Card title="Community-driven" icon="pencil">
    We want to provide a great value to the community.
    Thus, we want to listen what you want to make a great Open Source product for your needs!
	</Card>
  <Card title="Well-documented" icon="open-book">
    As we aim to create a project that is used by the community.
    For that, we will focus equally on the quality of our documentation and reference.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Open Source" icon="approve-check">
    We will keep this project Open Source.
    Files, scripts, documentation: you name it and it will be accessible for the community.
	</Card>
