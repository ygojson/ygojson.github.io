    First we will focus on JSON, but we won't stop there!
	</Card>
  <Card title="Community-driven" icon="pencil">
    We would like to provide a great value to the community and develop a great Open Source product for your needs.
    We want to listen what you want, so do not hesitate to give us feedback!
	</Card>
  <Card title="Well-documented" icon="open-book">
    We aim to create a project that is used by the community.
    For that, we will focus equally on the quality of our documentation and reference.
