YGOJSON is an open-source project aiming to create a catalog for the Yu-Gi-Oh card game in portable formats.

The idea is to fetch the data from different resources and combine all the data into formats that can be used by downstream applications in need of Yu-Gi-Oh! card game information.

## Formats

At the moment, the focus would be on the **JSON** format, but other formats would be considered once the project matures: CSV, SQL portable formats, etc.

## Collaborate

Collaborators can contribute to the discussion about:

- New properties to add to the models
- Providers to be used and data to be fetched
- New files/formats to be delivered
