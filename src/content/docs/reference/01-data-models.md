This is the YGOJSON data model reference.
It includes the JSON structure that are part of our delivered files.

:::note[API support]
Models on this reference can also be considered an API contract.

In the future we plan to have an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)
description for our models, to create RESTful APIs that are compatible
with the usage of YGOJSON.
